Python is a programming language which can be used for more general data science whereas R is used mainly for statistical analysis. Here's a little bit about me in a python code.
```{python}
#code for python

alisha_dict = {
'firstName': 'Alisha',
'lastName': 'Nayak',
'hobbies': ['movies','reading','crocheting/knitting', 'soccer', 'Animal Crossing'], 'occupation': ['student'], 'age': 21
}

print(alisha_dict)

```

We can also use python to adjust text to make it easier to read.
```{python}
import re
string="EtOH was used in the experiment"
re.sub(r"EtOH","Ethanol",string)

```

And there you have it! Here's a picture of one of my dogs, Milo.
